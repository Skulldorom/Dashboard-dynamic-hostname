# Dashboard dynamic hostname

dynamic hostname for homepage.dev using custom javascript and css, also adds a loading and confirmation banner

Uses [homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/)

## How to use

Copy and paste the code below into your homepage.dev page.

At the moment I've only used a single url to exclude but you can change that into a list and edit the if statment to check if the url is in the list.
